## **Mathematical Foundation**

### **1. K-Means Clustering Algorithm**

#### **Algorithmic Principle**
The K-Means algorithm groups data points into \( k \) clusters by minimizing the intra-cluster distance. The cost function \( J \) to minimize is defined as:

\[
J = \sum_{i=1}^k \sum_{x \in C_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2
\]

where:
- \( C_i \): The set of points in cluster \( i \).
- \( \mu_i \): The centroid of cluster \( i \).

#### **Anomaly Identification**
Outliers are detected based on their distance from the nearest centroid. Let \( d(x, \mu_i) \) denote the Euclidean distance between a point \( x \) and centroid \( \mu_i \). If \( d(x, \mu_i) > \tau \) (threshold), \( x \) is flagged as an anomaly.

#### **Euclidean Distance Formula**
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
\]

Where:
- \( x_i, y_i \): Coordinates of the points in n-dimensional space.

### **2. Theoretical Guarantee**

#### **Theorem: Convergence of K-Means**
K-Means clustering converges to a local minimum of the cost function \( J \).

**Proof (Sketch):**
1. Each iteration reduces \( J \) by updating centroids and reassigning points.
2. Since \( J \) is bounded below (non-negative), the algorithm terminates.
3. The algorithm achieves convergence in finite steps due to a finite number of cluster assignments.

#### **Complexity Analysis**
1. Assignment Step: \( O(nk) \), where \( n \) is the number of points and \( k \) is the number of clusters.
2. Update Step: \( O(n) \).
3. Overall Complexity: \( O(nki) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations.

## **Code Demonstration**

### **Clustering Model Implementation**
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

class ClusteringModel:
    def __init__(self, n_clusters=2):
        self.model = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters)

    def train(self, data):
        self.model.fit(data)

    def predict(self, data):
        return self.model.predict(data)

# Example Usage
data = [[0.1, 0.2], [0.15, 0.25], [5.0, 5.2]]
model = ClusteringModel(n_clusters=2)
model.train(data)
result = model.predict([[5.1, 5.3]])
print("Anomaly detected:" if result[0] else "No anomaly detected")
```

### **Mathematical Validation in Python**
```python
import numpy as np

def euclidean_distance(point1, point2):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((np.array(point1) - np.array(point2))**2))

# Example Points
p1 = [1, 2]
p2 = [4, 6]

print("Distance:", euclidean_distance(p1, p2))
```
